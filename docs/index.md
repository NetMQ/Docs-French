NetMQ
===================

NetMQ is 100% native C# port of ZeroMQ.

NetMQ is lightweight messaging library which extends the standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products. NetMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport protocols and more.

The best to start learning NetMQ is to read the [ZeroMQ Guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all).
